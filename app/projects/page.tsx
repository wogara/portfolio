          In collaboration with HR&A Advisors, I spearheaded the development of
          an internet speed testing tool as part of a significant statewide
          initiative. This ambitious project was designed to analyze and enhance
          digital equity across several states, contributing substantially to
          the broader goal of digital inclusivity.

          I developed a dynamic website for Soulacoasta, an artist from Jamaica,
          to enhance his online presence. The project focused on SEO, a custom
          music player, and a content management system using Sanity.io,
          allowing easy updates for shows and visuals. Built with Next.js, the
          site perfectly reflects Soulacoastaâ€™s brand, connecting him with fans
          and setting the stage for future growth.

          I played a key role in the Texas Digital Opportunity Plan by
          developing an interactive public comment platform in collaboration
          with the Texas Broadband Office. The platform, built using Node.js,
          Express, and MySQL, featured a bilingual user interface and automated
          email confirmation system. This initiative was crucial in gathering
          public insights to enhance digital equity across the state.

          I developed a stylish and functional e-commerce website for Drip Drop
          Apparel, a cutting-edge clothing brand. The site features secure
          payment processing, real-time order tracking via Google Sheets API,
          and dynamic cart functionality. With MongoDB for robust data
          management and seamless email notifications through the Gmail API, the
          platform embodies the ethos of the brand while delivering a smooth shopping
          experience.
