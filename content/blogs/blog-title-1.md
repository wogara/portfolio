# Procurement

Freelance website development is all about connections. My business partner is a DJ, and he has been asking other DJs in various clubs if they need a website. That's when Soulacoasta mentioned that his web presence isn't as top notch as it could be.

# Initial Meeting

We scheduled a meeting to see what was needed here. We came to a few conclusions.

- SEO
- Showcase music
- Tell his story
- Let fans know where and when he's playing
- Photo album
- Eventually a shop page
- Allow fans to connect
- Portal to control content

# Tech Stack

We decided to go with Nextjs for a few reasons

- Wide support
- Reusable components
- Easy and affordable deployments with hosting services like vercel

# CSM
