# Procurement

**Freelance website development** thrives on connections, and in this case, it was no different. My business partner, a DJ himself, tapped into his network to find opportunities. During one of these conversations, Soulacoasta, an artist from Jamaica, mentioned that his web presence wasn't where it needed to be. 

# Initial Meeting

Our first meeting laid the groundwork for what Soulacoasta envisioned for his online presence. We pinpointed key elements that would make his website not just a digital space, but a true reflection of his brand. The essentials included:

- **SEO:** To make sure he stands out in searches.
- **Showcasing music:** A must for any artist, with an integrated music player.
- **Storytelling:** Sharing his journey to connect with his audience.
- **Event updates:** Letting fans know where and when he's performing.
- **Photo album:** A visual diary of his experiences.
- **Shop page:** A future addition to sell merchandise.
- **Fan connection:** Building a community around his music.
- **Content management portal:** Giving him control over updates.

# Tech Stack

After weighing our options, we chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).
 for this project. Here’s why:

- **Wide support:** A robust framework with a strong community.
- **Reusable components:** Efficient development and future scalability.
- **Affordable deployment:** Services like Vercel made hosting easy and cost-effective.

# CMS Setup

To keep the content dynamic and easily manageable, we integrated Sanity.io as the CMS. This allows Soulacoasta to update shows and visuals effortlessly, with dedicated pages for each.

# Conclusion

This project was more than just building a website; it was about creating an experience that truly represents Soulacoasta’s brand. From the custom music player to the seamless integration of visuals and events, every element was crafted with care. The combination of Next.js and Sanity.io provided the perfect balance of performance and flexibility, ensuring that Soulacoasta’s online presence is as vibrant and dynamic as his music.
